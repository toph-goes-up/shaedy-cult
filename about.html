<div id='aboutus'><title>A BIT ABOUT US</title>
    <p>
        We are a super trustworthy, and not creepy in any way, company filled with love for green paper.  Established
        in 2015, we gained support quickly and our wonderful Kool-Aid started changing lives.  We want to thank 
        all of our supporters, even though they aren't with us anymore.

    <p>I have a direct line to God and have his explicit blessing
    to create this wonderful drink and bring his sheeple back
    to him in the afterlife.</p>

    <p>I am the moral support for the amazing leader that is my husband.  His communion with God is a miracle and 
    everyone should be able to take advantage of his divine greatness.  Kool-Aid for the win!</p>
